A rule consists of a keyword, a response, an user rating, a system rating, and the number of time it has been used. It allows the user to add new conversation rule, remove a rule, display a;; the current rules, modify the rating of a rule, and initiate a discussion. After a diccussion the program will ask if the response was useful and update the system rating of the rule based on that. When printing thr rules is the program uses printPreOrder.
